By default, your Ubuntu command line prompt might look something like this:  

`username@DESKTOP-XXXXXX`  

You can change the name of the PC (`DESKTOP-XXXXXX` in this instance) by searching Windows for `About your PC`. Within these settings, you should see a button labeled "Rename this PC". Click this button and choose a new name for your PC.  

### Change time zone for Ubuntu  

Change the time zone for Ubuntu using the following command:  

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`
